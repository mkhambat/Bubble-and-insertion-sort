# Bubble-and-insertion-sort

My program picks up 50,000 random numbers in batches of 2000, 4000, 6000 ..... 50,000 in 
a. Ascending order
b. Descending order
c. Random order
and sorts it using bubble sort and insertion sort. The time taken by each algorithm to sort 2000, 4000, 6000 .... 50,000 numbers is then ploted on a graph (running time vs input size) (grapgh.docx file) to analyse and compare running time of both the algorithms.
